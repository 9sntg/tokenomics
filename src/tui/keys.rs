//! Key event → `Action` mapping (pure).

//! Project: Tokenomics — monitor LLM subscription accounts (usage, limits, time-left) in a TUI
//! Module:  src/tui/keys.rs
//! Deps:    crossterm (event types)
//! Tested:  inline `#[cfg(test)]`
//!
//! Design constraints:
//! - Pure: a key event maps to at most one `Action`. No I/O.
